# localengine

For situations where you're traveling without service or wifi such as on an airplane,  
put directories containing HTML documents into localengine `search/` directory and run the  
server locally to be able to search and index them.

## Usage

* Put directory containing HTML into `serach/`

* Search using the search bar!

---

## Notes

Firefox doesn't let you link to file URIs in anchors for security reasons, so the URI is shown but not linked.
